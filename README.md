# MLB-Arsenal-Tendencies

Created a leaderboard exploring tendencies created by different arsenals during 2023 for my article "The Case for the Curveball". Explored arsenal features (with a focus on curveballs) and explored what caused the potential differences in arsenal wOBA/ISO/Chase%. 

Used heavy data cleaning on Alex Chamberlain's Pitch Leaderboard to make data effective for exploration, which can be found in ChamberlainPitchClean.R
